Install the https://grails.github.io/gorm-graphql/latest/guide/index.html[GORM GraphQL] plugin by adding this line to the `dependencies` section in `build.gradle`:

[source, javascript]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0,tag=graphqldependency]
----

Now, to generate a GraphQL schema for your domain classes, all that is needed is to add a `static graphql` property to the domain class in question. This will cause a GraphQL schema to be generated based on the properties in the domain class, following the constraints specified in the `constraints` block.

[source, javascript]
.grails-app/domain/gormgraphql/Talk.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/gormgraphql/Talk.groovy[indent=0]
----

If you need to customize the behavior of the GraphQL schema, you can assign the `graphql` property to a custom `GraphQLMapping`, using the DSL provided by the plugin. This is not a requirement for this guide, however a few of the supported options are shown in the `Speaker` domain class.


[source, javascript]
.grails-app/domain/gormgraphql/Speaker.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/gormgraphql/Speaker.groovy[indent=0]
----
<1> Set property ordering
<2> Exclude property from the schema
<3> Deprecate a property (can also be set to `deprecated: true`)
<4> Custom data fetcher, for providing custom logic when retrieving the property
<5> Adding a (non persistent) property to the GraphQL schema

NOTE: You can learn all the available features of the GORM GraphQL plugin https://grails.github.io/gorm-graphql/snapshot/guide/index.html[from the plugin documentation].
