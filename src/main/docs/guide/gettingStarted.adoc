In this guide you will learn how to leverage GORM's support for GraphQL. You will configure Grails to act as a GraphQL server,

The `initial` sample project already has a simple conference-related REST API (consisting of two domain classes, `Speaker` and `Talk`) configured using the `@Resource` annotation. The project is using the `react-webpack` profile, and a simple React app has been provided which will list out the speakers, as well as the talks belonging to each speaker.

The React app is quite trivial and naively uses the default REST API provided by Grails - e.g, the app makes one REST call to list the speakers, and then iterates over the talk ids for each speaker, making a separate REST call to get the details for each talk. This means that a single load of the app can require many REST calls simply to acquire the data needed to render the app.

```
http://localhost:8080/speaker	200	fetch	1.6 KB	851 ms
http://localhost:8080/talk/1	200	fetch	260 B	262 ms
http://localhost:8080/talk/2	200	fetch	273 B	310 ms
http://localhost:8080/talk/3	200	fetch	254 B	299 ms
http://localhost:8080/talk/4	200	fetch	261 B	297 ms
http://localhost:8080/talk/5	200	fetch	293 B	284 ms

```

Of course there are a few ways we could resolve this problem using standard REST techniques, including hypermedia, or customized endpoints (using http://views.grails.org[JSON Views], for example) - however in more complex apps it is possible that this could lead to a proliferation of custom endpoints providing different combinations of data. In addition, some endpoints might provide more data than the app actually requires -  there is no way to express the desired "piece" of data in a typical REST API.

This is where GraphQL shines - it allows consumers of our API, whether private clients (like our own Single-Page Applications) or public users, to specify the exact pieces of data that they need, in a declarative way. GraphQL queries can even be https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/a-stronger-typed-react-apollo-c43bd52be0d8[codifed as Flow types], making the data requirements of your components explicit and testable.
