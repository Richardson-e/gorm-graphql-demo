Our React app is fairly simple, consisting of 3 main components, `SpeakerList`, `Speaker`, and `Talk`. The first two of these components include REST calls to load their data. Let's replace these calls with a GraphQL query.

Edit `src/main/webapp/SpeakerList.js`

[source,javascript]
./src/main/webapp/SpeakerList.js
----
import React, {Component} from 'react'
import Speaker from "./Speaker";
import {graphql} from 'react-apollo'; //<1>
import gql from 'graphql-tag';  //<2>

class SpeakerList extends Component {

//<3>
  render() {
    const speakers = this.props.data.speakerList; //<4>
    return speakers ? [speakers.map(s => <Speaker key={s.id} speaker={s}/>)] : <p>Loading...</p>
  }
}

const SPEAKER_QUERY = gql`query {	speakerList(max: 10) { //<5>
  id, firstName, lastName,
    talks { id }
  }
}`;

//<6>
const SpeakerListWithData = graphql(SPEAKER_QUERY,
    {options: {pollInterval: 5000}} //<7>
)(SpeakerList);
export default SpeakerListWithData; //<8>
----
<1> The `graphql` is a https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html[*higher-order component*], which means that it wraps an existing component and returns a new component with additional behavior.
<2> `gql` is JavaScript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals[template literal tag] that will parse our GraphQL queries
<3> Note that we were able to completely remove our `componentDidMount` method (where the REST call had been made) and our constructor, as we no longer need to use `this.state`.
<4> The data returned by our GraphQL query will be available via `this.props.data.[name of query]` - in this case, `speakerList`.
<5> This constant represents our query - note that the syntax is the same as what you might have used in the GraphiQL browser.
<6> Rather than exporting `SpeakerList` directly, we first "wrap" it using the `graphql` higher-order component, which will "connect" our `SpeakerList` component with our GraphQL schema, pass in our data requirements, and provide the data via the `data` prop within `SpeakerList`.
<7> We've specified a `pollInterval`, which is one of several options available from `graphql`. This option will cause our GraphQL query to be run once every 10 seconds, updating our component with any new data automatically.
<8> Finally, we export the "connected" version of `SpeakerList` as the default module.

At this point, if you restart the application (or run `./gradlew webpack` in another terminal, to reload the JavaScript), you will see the React app is now retrieving the speakers via the GraphQL schema.

Moving on the the `Speaker` component, we can again remove the `componentDidMount` method, and we can remove the `this.state.talks` property. Instead, in the `render` method, we will access each speakers' talks directly from the `speaker` prop.

[source,javascript]
./src/main/webapp/Speaker.js
----
import React, {Component} from 'react'
import {Well} from 'react-bootstrap'
import Talk from "./Talks";

class Speaker extends Component {

  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      title: '',
      duration: ''
    }
  }

//... other methods ommitted for space

  render() {
    const {speaker} = this.props;
    const {title, duration} = this.state;

    return <Well>
      <h3>{speaker.firstName} {speaker.lastName}</h3>
      <hr/>

      <ul>
        {speaker.talks.map(t => <Talk key={t.id} talk={t} delete={() => this.deleteTalk(t.id)}/>)}
        <li>
          <label>Title</label>
          <input type='text' name='title' value={title}
                 onChange={this.handleNewTalkChange}/>

          <label>Duration</label>
          <input type="number" name="duration" value={duration}
                 onChange={this.handleNewTalkChange}/>
          <button onClick={this.addNewTalk}>Add Talk</button>
        </li>
      </ul>

    </Well>
  }
}

export default Speaker;

However, if we try to run the app now we will find that we only have access to the ids of each talk - we are missing `title` and `duration`. Thanks to GraphQL, we can easily add these properties to our retrieved data by simply adding them to the query.

Edit `src/main/webapp/SpeakerList.js` and add `title` and `duration` to the `SPEAKER_QUERY`.

[source,javascript]
./src/main/webapp/SpeakerList.js
----

const SPEAKER_QUERY = gql`query {
speakerList(max: 10) {
  id, firstName, lastName,
    talks { id, title, duration } //<1>
  }
}`;
----

With that, our multiple REST calls have been replaced with a single GraphQL query. You can inspect this query, and the response, using your Apollo's https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-devtools[developer tools browser extension].
